# CS5002 Discrete Structure final group project

Teammates: Letian Qin, Michael Mills, Phillip Tran, Danyang Feng

Our project is a text-based adventure website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It focuses on children's stories that teach number representations and conversions through interactive lessons. The website features captivating chapters, each with its own standalone story. Children solve problems and progress based on their answers, exploring different number bases. Our goal is to make learning enjoyable while building critical thinking skills.
